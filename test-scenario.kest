# Test Scenario for Kest
# This demonstrates retry, duration check, and parallel execution

# Quick API test (should be fast)
get https://httpbin.org/uuid --max-duration 3000

# POST with retry
post https://httpbin.org/post -d '{"test": "data"}' --retry 2

# Delay test (might be slow but acceptable)
get https://httpbin.org/delay/1 --max-duration 2000

# Another quick test
get https://httpbin.org/headers
