# 🦅 Kest Vision: Keep Every Step Tested

## 🎯 The Core Philosophy

In the era of **Vibe Coding** and **Agentic Development**, software is moving faster than ever. Requirements change in hours, and code is often generated by AI agents. Traditional testing tools (Postman, Cypress) are too heavy, too manual, or too detached from the source of truth.

**Kest** was born from a simple belief: **The documentation should be the test, and the test should be the documentation.**

### 🌊 Flow-Driven Development
We believe testing should happen in a "flow"—a natural sequence of business logic that mimics how users actually interact with your API.

## 🚀 Key Pillars of Kest

### 1. 📝 Markdown as the Source of Truth
We don't want you to learn another DSL. Use standard Markdown (`.flow.md`). 
- It’s human-readable for developers.
- It’s machine-readable for Kest.
- It’s **agent-friendly** for AI to generate and execute.

### 2. 🦅 Keep Every Step Tested
The name **Kest** stands for "Keep Every Step Tested." 
- **Automatic Recording**: Every request sent through Kest is recorded in a local SQLite database. 
- **Tracing & Debugging**: Instantly re-play failures and see the exact difference between "Success" and "Failure".
- **Business Logic Chains**: Don't just test endpoints; test the *relationships* between them (Variables, Captures, Assertions).

### 3. 🤖 Built for the Agentic Era
Kest is designed specifically to be the "hands" of an AI Coding Assistant:
- **CLI-First**: Easy for agents to run in terminals.
- **Traceability**: Agents can "see" historical successes and learn from them.
- **Simplified Syntax**: No complex JS/TS scripts needed for basic flows.

### 4. 🌍 Multi-Environment Lifecycle
Kest bridges the gap from Local Development to Production:
- Test against your local server.
- Switch to Staging with a single command.
- Periodically "Smoke Test" Production using the same Flow files.

## 🗺 The Roadmap: Where We're Heading

### Phase 1: The Core (Current)
- [x] CLI execution engine.
- [x] Markdown Flow support.
- [x] Basic Assertions and Captures.
- [x] Local History and Replay.

### Phase 2: Collaboration & Intelligence (Next)
- [ ] **Kest Platform**: Sync local flows to a centralized dashboard.
- [ ] **Smart Assertions**: AI-suggested assertions based on JSON schemas.
- [ ] **Mocking**: Instantly mock external dependencies from recorded history.

### Phase 3: Autonomous Testing
- [ ] **Self-Healing Tests**: If an API changes, Kest suggests updates to the Flow file.
- [ ] **Continuous Monitoring**: Run flows as cron jobs and alert on SLA breaches.

## 🦅 Conclusion

Kest is not just a tester; it's a **behavioral archive** for your API. It ensures that as your code evolves at the speed of thought, your quality remains grounded in reality.

**Keep Every Step Tested.**
